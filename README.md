# reje

reje is a simple racing engine in Haskell and using SDL.  It imitates racers
from the early 80's by making simple perspective calculations.

Run `stack install` and then run either just `reje` or `reje <track>`
where `<track>` is one of

  - `forw`
  - `hzig`
  - `up`
  - `vzig`
  - `zig`
  - `bumps`
